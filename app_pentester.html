                            Businesses rely on web applications more than they ever have in the past to conduct daily business. That includes customer-facing applications that allow them to perform activities like making purchases or transferring money from one account to another. Many companies also depend on internal web products to conduct day-to-day business. Developers may use open source components and plugins when building web apps, opening the door to possible security risks.

                            Thanks to constant technological advancements and our growing dependency on the internet, cyber thieves have an unlimited new frontier of attack vectors to exploit. They move from one website to another, looking for that one security weakness that aids them in their quest.

                            The ideal time to conduct web application penetration testing would be before a production release. However, schedule pressures often lead to developers deploying applications without putting them through the proper security paces. That can leave web applications ripe for exploitation by hackers.

                            RedTeam Security steps in to address the security flaws left in development and production web applications and APIs. Our specialist comes in and acts as an ethical hacker to help companies stop accumulating technical debt from past mistakes. Our goal is to help businesses feel confident going forward with cybersecurity protection offered by RedTeam Security specialists.

                        <p>
                            Web application penetration testing involves testing the security integrity of a company’s browser-based applications. RedTeam Security evaluates the attack surface of all potentially vulnerable web-based services, including APIs and web interfaces. We execute the same steps malicious might perform to penetrate the security and gain access to protected information or enter a company’s internal systems.

                        <h1 class="header-article"> Threats</h1>
                        <p>
                            RedTeam Security pen testers have backgrounds in software development. They understand the common mistakes developers can make, so they go beyond merely trying to break a web application. Our experts use their experience to find critical issues before they become a security crisis.

                            The following vulnerabilities represent some of the top OWASP security risks to web applications.

                            SQL Injection — Hackers alter the SQL statements used in an application’s backend. These sql injection attacks trick it into executing commands that provide unauthorized access to data.
                            Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) — Applications that execute scripts in the browser receive and run untrustworthy requests. Hackers use those malicious scripts to perform actions like defacing websites, hijacking cookie sessions, or redirecting unsuspecting users to websites where they can steal their information.
                            Broken Authentication and Poor Session Management — Websites typically invalidate cookies for a session once a user closes a browser or logs out of a website. If that invalidation doesn’t happen, and the session remains open, hackers can hijack those still-valid cookies and get hold of the sensitive information it contains. 
                            Security Misconfiguration — Developers who fail to properly define the security configuration for a web application and related components leave it vulnerable to unauthorized access by a hacker. Areas they like to target include URLs and input fields.
                            Insecure Deserialization — When data under the control of a user becomes deserialized by a website, attackers can manipulate it by passing harmful information into the source code.
                            XML External Entities Injection (XXE) — Attackers interfere with how a web application processes XML data. Attackers can then view files on the server and access back-end systems on which the web application relies. 
                            Broken Access Controls — Users may end up with access to restricted resources or can perform functions outside of their designated roles. That leaves an organization vulnerable to an attack from the inside.
                            Vulnerable Components — Developers may use components in their website that may be out-of-date, susceptible to attack, or unsupported. Hackers gain an opening through which they can steal sensitive information or hijack a company’s systems.

                        <h1 class="header-article"> Web Application Penetration Testing Vs. Vulnerability Scans</h1>
                        <p>
                            One of the biggest mistakes an organization can make is conflating penetration testing with a vulnerability scan. While each plays an essential role in cyber risk analysis, they represent different control methods. Understanding those differences is critical to making sure your web applications can stand up to brute force attacks from bad actors.

                            Vulnerability scans typically use automation to detect vulnerabilities in devices attached to the network like routers, firewalls, servers, applications, and switches. The purpose of running a vulnerability assessment is to identify the location of those weaknesses. Relying on vulnerability scans to evaluate web application risks can be less costly for businesses.

                            Web app penetration testing is more targeted in scope. While vulnerability scans identify threats, a web app pen testing relies on having someone with experience using various tools to mimic a cyber attacker’s deliberate acts, or the inadvertent actions a user might take that could expose critical information. They try to find the most at-risk entry points into a web application’s inner workings.
